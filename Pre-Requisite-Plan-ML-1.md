# Machine Learning Curriculum: From Theory to Production
# Characteristics of an Algorithm: 
  An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps or instructions designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It is a systematic approach to problem-solving that outlines the essential actions or operations to be performed in a clear and unambiguous manner
- Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming languages

# Key Characteristics

# 1. Well-Defined Steps :
Algorithms consist of a specific and unambiguous set of instructions or steps that can be followed to perform a particular task or solve a problem. Each step must be well-defined, leaving no room for ambiguity or confusion
# 2.Input and Output :
Algorithms take inputs, which are the initial data or information provided to the algorithm, and produce outputs, which are the results or solutions generated by the algorithm after processing the inputs
 The relationship between the inputs and outputs is determined by the algorithm's logic
# 3.Finiteness:
Algorithms must have a well-defined termination condition. This means that they eventually reach an endpoint or conclusion after a finite number of steps. If an algorithm runs indefinitely without termination, it is considered incorrect or incomplete
# 4. Determinism : 
Algorithms are deterministic, meaning that given the same inputs and executed under the same conditions, they will always produce the same outputs. The behavior of an algorithm should be predictable and consistent
# 5. Efficiency:
Algorithms aim to be efficient in terms of time and resources. They strive to solve problems or perform tasks in a reasonable amount of time and with optimal use of computational resources like memory, processing power, or storage
# 6. Generality:
An algorithm should be designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task, but it should also be applicable to a broader class of instances or scenarios. It should have a certain level of flexibility and adaptability
# 7.Correctness :
Algorithms must be designed to produce correct results for all valid inputs within their domain. They must accurately solve the problem they are designed for, and their outputs must match the expected results
# 8.Modularity and Reusability :
Algorithms can be modular, meaning they can be divided into smaller subproblems or functions that can be reused in different parts of the algorithm or in other algorithms. This promotes code organization, maintainability, and code reuse
# 9. Understandability :
Algorithms should be designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, making them easy to understand and implement. Well-documented and readable code can enhance the understandability of an algorithm

Examples : 

. FindMaximum Algorithm: This algorithm follows the characteristics mentioned earlier. It is well-defined, specifying the steps to find the maximum element. It takes an input array and produces the output of the maximum element. The algorithm terminates after iterating through all the elements of the array, ensuring finiteness. It is deterministic and language-independent, allowing it to be implemented in any programming language

. IsPalindrome Algorithm: This algorithm also follows the characteristics mentioned earlier. It is well-defined, specifying the steps to check if a string is a palindrome. It takes an input string and produces the output of True or False based on whether the string is a palindrome or not. The algorithm terminates when the start index becomes greater than or equal to the end index, ensuring finiteness. It is deterministic and language-independent, allowing it to be implemented in any programming language

. DijkstraShortestPath Algorithm: This algorithm, known as Dijkstra's Algorithm, follows the characteristics mentioned earlier. It is well-defined, specifying the steps to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It takes an input weighted graph and a source vertex, and it produces the output of an array with the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices. The algorithm terminates when the priority queue is empty, ensuring finiteness. It is deterministic and language-independent, allowing it to be implemented in any programming language

. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for designing and evaluating algorithms, ensuring they are effective and efficient in solving problems and performing tasks

## ü§ñ 1. ANN ‚Äì **Artificial Neural Network**

### üìå What It Is:

The **basic neural network** model inspired by how the brain works ‚Äî the foundation of all other networks (DNN, CNN, RNN).

### üì¶ Structure:

* **Input Layer** ‚Äì takes raw features (like age, salary, pixels, etc.)
* **Hidden Layers** ‚Äì perform weighted calculations and activations.
* **Output Layer** ‚Äì gives final prediction (e.g., yes/no, class A/B, or price).

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:

Each node (neuron) does:

```math
Output = Activation(W1*X1 + W2*X2 + ... + B)
```

* Weights (**W**) and bias (**B**) are learned through training.
* Activation = sigmoid, ReLU, etc.

### üéØ Use Case:

### üìå What It Is:

Specialized for **image and spatial data**.

### üß© Why Different?

* Instead of feeding raw pixel values directly (like ANN), CNN:

  * Uses **filters** to detect patterns (edges, textures).
  * Preserves **spatial structure** (e.g., where things are in an image).

### üß± Building Blocks:

* **Convolution Layer**: Slide filters over image to extract features.

## ‚è≥ 4. RNN ‚Äì **Recurrent Neural Network**

### üìå What It Is:

Designed for **sequential data** ‚Äî data that has order & memory (e.g., time series, text).

### üîÅ How It Works:

* RNN has **loops** ‚Äî the output from a step is passed as input to the **next time step**.
* Each neuron has **memory** of previous inputs.

### üîÑ Formula:

```math
h(t) = f(W * x(t) + U * h(t-1) + b)
```

Where:

* `x(t)` is current input
* `h(t-1)` is past memory
* `W, U` are weights

### üéØ Use Case:

* Text generation
* Sentiment analysis
* Stock price prediction

## üîç Self-Attention (The Heart of Transformers)

Each word looks at **all other words** in the sentence and asks:

> ‚ÄúHow much attention should I pay to every other word when deciding my meaning?‚Äù

Example:

```
Input: "The cat sat on the mat"
When decoding "sat", it may attend to:
- "cat" (who sat)
- "mat" (where sat)
```

So the model builds a **weighted understanding** of relationships.

## üß† GPT Architecture Overview (Decoder-Only Transformer)

GPT is based on the **decoder block** of the Transformer (unlike BERT, which uses the encoder).
Its main purpose is: **given a context, generate the next token**.
